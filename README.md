## What containers are there?
### Source
A container of all of the **functional** code related to our project.

# How do I use this?
If you want to use **.ino** files, you'll have to use a valid Arduino IDE, where you can open it, verify and then proceed to send it over to the Arduino board of choice.
# How do I contribute?
To contribute to the repo, you can create code files in the _Source_ container.
# I have an issue, who do I contact?
If there are any problems involving the files, or you have questions about the repo, feel free to contact [Roland](https://github.com/vrs2210).
